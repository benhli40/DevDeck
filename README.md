# 🃏 DevDeck

> A card-style dashboard for developers who keep forgetting that one Git command (you know the one).

**DevDeck** is a lightweight, modular cheat-sheet app that lets developers create, view, favorite, and filter their most-used commands, APIs, terminal tricks, and more. Think of it as your personal dev toolbox — but cooler, organized, and actually used.

Built with **Vanilla JS** because we don’t need no stinkin’ frameworks (unless we want to, respectfully).

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a developer, I kept losing my favorite commands, terminal tricks, and shortcut muscle memory. I wanted a way to:

- Keep everything in one visual place
- Personalize my most-used tools
- And make it actually *fun* to interact with

So I built DevDeck — a clean, no-framework cheat sheet system that I’d actually use. And I think other devs will too.
